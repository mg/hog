What is this?

Hi.

My name is Magnús Örn Gylfason and I will be posting some Go code on this blog.

I'm doing this both as a way to learn Go and also as a bit of a homage to one of my favourite programming books, [Higher-Order Perl](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558607013) (by Mark Jason Dominus, published by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Copyright 2005 by Elsevier Inc.) I highly recommend it even if you don't write Perl code (which I don't).

The code will also be available at [https://github.com/mg/hog](https://github.com/mg/hog).

My native tongue is Icelandic so I will be heavily depending on Google Chrome's spelling checker to get me through this, please feel free to point out any spelling mistakes (or other kinds of mistakes) I make.

You can contact me both on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/110366795402129628657/posts) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mgns74).
