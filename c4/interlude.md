Chapter three is finished and with it the first 113 pages of the book. Now the first realy long chapter begins, counting about 80 pages. It is about iterators, and for me it is one of the core concepts of the book.

My strategy for this chapter is to read through the whole chapter and do the examples before posting. I want do figure out a good way to do iterators in Go that scales well across the examples in the book. I'm nearly finished and the first example should be posted soon.
