Interlude

Chapter 5 is a short one and itt can be split into logical two parts. The first one is about turning recursive functions into iterators and ends with a general strategy to create generic search iterators.

The second part covers some alternative strategies to turn recursive functions into loops. Here we focus on *tail-call* elimination and variations thereof.
